If the answer cannot be found in the passage, respond with 'The passage does not provide this information.'\n\nPASSAGE:\nThe Great Fire of London began on September 2, 1666, in a bakery on Pudding Lane owned by Thomas Farriner. The fire spread rapidly due to strong easterly winds and the predominance of wooden buildings. Over four days, it destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 churches, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. Remarkably, the official death toll was recorded as only six people, though historians believe the actual number was likely higher as deaths among the poor and middle class were not always recorded. After the fire, architect Christopher Wren was commissioned to redesign many buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral, which took 35 years to complete.\n\nQUESTION: How many years did it take to rebuild St. Paul's Cathedral, and who was the chief architect?"
