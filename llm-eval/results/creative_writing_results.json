        "cot": "The wind howled through the narrow, old lighthouse, shaking the ancient structure as it leaned slightly into its moorings. Inside the keeper's quarters, the ticking clock and his beloved lantern were an attempt to console himself with familiarity in this vast expanse of darkness. The sea was calm tonight, a rare occurrence for this part of the world.\n\nAs he tended to the lantern that had been his friend since day one, every now and then his fingers would drift over its surface, feeling the years it bore witness to. There were prayers carved into the brass, little notes slipped inside from distant shores, maps drawn with tiny chalk dust. Each piece was a testament to his dedication.\n\nHe couldn't help but think of all these times he had stood here, staring at the sea and praying that the lantern would always guide safely to those who needed it most. The wind became even stronger, blowing away any possibility of sleep. He finally decided to check the light's status, slipping into a darkened hallway.\n\nWith each flickering candle, a new detail appeared: the beams were now angled in such a way that they pointed towards what was supposed to be the horizon. But as he turned his head to examine it more closely, something shifted inside him. The waves no longer seemed like mere reflection; they started rolling over the landscape instead of sailing across it.\n\nWith each step deeper into this strange reality, the keeper found himself walking on a path that led through an unknown sea – not only one without ships but one where ships had become nothing more than shadows in his mind's eye. This was not just another lighthouse he was guarding; it was a place now haunted by something else entirely.\n\nRealization dawned then: The light they saw wasn't the guiding force for boats, but an entity that could shape them into shapes and spirits of its own creation. It was a reality beyond his imagination, a reflection in time itself, a journey through thoughts and memories without end.\n\nIn the silence of the night, he whispered to himself words of resignation: \"The light isn't there anymore.\" Yet as dawn broke over the horizon, he knew it wouldn't be gone entirely; it would always remain with him.",
        "few_shot": "Input: Write a short story (200-300 words) with the following prompt:\n\n'A lighthouse keeper discovers that the light they've been maintaining for 30 years doesn't guide ships—it guides something else entirely.'\n\nRequirements:\n- First-person perspective from the lighthouse keeper\n- Include at least one moment of realization\n- Create a sense of mystery without fully explaining the ending\n\nOutput:\nThe old lantern in my hands felt foreign, unlike any light I had wielded before. It was weak and flickering, barely enough to see by itself. The coast stretched out as far as the eye could reach, but instead of guiding ships into the harbor, it seemed to dance aimlessly across the waves.\n\nI tried different angles, hoping something would change. But no matter where I focused my light, nothing changed. My eyes grew heavy with exhaustion; there was nothing left in me to keep this experiment going.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and still the lantern remained a mystery. Finally, as summer came to its end, I decided it might be time for an intervention. I climbed aboard the lifeboat that served as my home and set sail out of sight of land, determined to confront whatever secrets lay within this strange beacon of light.\n\nThe wind pushed us harder and harder until we nearly capsized. And then, as if by magic, the lantern began to pulse in rhythm with something unseen. Ships appeared on our horizon, steering towards what was once just a guiding light for them. I watched them disappear one by one, each ship disappearing into darkness, only to reappear later under the same starlit sky.\n\nI returned home, my journey a tale of hope and despair interwoven in its own intricate tapestry. The lantern had finally found its purpose: not as a beacon for ships, but as a mirror reflecting our fears, hopes, and the weight of human existence itself.\n\nAnd so, in the end, the lighthouse keeper learned that light is not just a tool to guide others; it's an invitation—a way to see into one's own heart.",
        "zero_shot": "I stood by my lighthouse, its beacon spinning with each gust of wind. The years had passed me by, but I still remembered every detail: the first light to guide ships away from rocks, the last night it shone on an empty ocean.\n\nToday was no different. Ships kept coming in, their crews desperate for guidance at sea's edge. Each one asked if the beacon worked. But I knew better; I'd been through this routine too many times. The lighthouse hadn't changed much since my father built it over 30 years ago. Nothing could be wrong with these lamps unless... Unless...\n\nThe lanterns began to flicker, dimmer each minute. Panic set in as ships dropped anchor closer, their captains calling out for help. I knew what was happening now: the light wasn't guiding ships; it was attracting them instead.\n\nI ran down to where the lamps sat on the shelf, hands shaking as I pulled one off its holder. The air grew thick with tension as I turned it slowly around until I found that last corner where all the flickering seemed to converge. There, a ghostly figure appeared: tall and hunched, it moved between the lighthouse's beams like an apparition.\n\nThe light wasn't just guiding ships; it was drawing them in. As I watched, one ship after another approached my beacon until there were more than enough for its presence to be felt on the sea. The captain of each asked why they couldn't see what he saw, but no answers came back until...\n\nThe lights finally went out, the world around me darkened like it had never been lit by anything at all. I turned and walked away from my lighthouse, leaving behind a scene that should have been an end to me. It wasn't over yet.\n\nFor 30 years, I'd kept this place running as best I could, but now I understood: the light was telling stories, not just about ships sailing safely through stormy seas. And in doing so, it transformed the very meaning of my work from a task to something much greater – creating memories for those who never made it back home.\n\nAnd as darkness fell over this island, I realized that no lighthouse keeper could ever leave their job without leaving behind a lesson: sometimes, the light we create isn't just about us – but also what happens after."

        "few_shot": "**The Light in the Fog**  \n\nFor thirty years, I've climbed the spiral stairs at dusk, my hands steady on the lantern's glass globe. The light cuts through the fog, a beacon for ships—so I've always believed. But lately, the sea feels different. Ships pass miles offshore, their horns silent. No thanks to me.  \n\nLast week, I stayed up past midnight, watching the beam sweep the horizon. Something moved in the mist, not a ship. A flicker, then a shadow—too large, too deliberate. It hovered just beyond the reach of the light, as if testing it. My breath fogged the glass. I've seen whales in these waters, but this… this was *alive*.  \n\nTonight, I followed the light's arc again, my pulse thudding in time with the waves. The shadow returned, closer now. It wasn't a whale. It had *shape*—a tall, shifting figure, its outline dissolving like smoke whenever the beam touched it. My hands trembled. For thirty years, I've thought this light saved lives. What if it's calling something else?  \n\nThe figure tilted its head, as if hearing my unspoken question. Then it vanished, leaving only the sound of the sea—and the weight of a secret I can't unsee.  \n\nI'll keep the light burning. But now, I wonder: what's out there, waiting in the dark?",
        "zero_shot": "**The Keeper's Log**  \n\nI've tended this light for thirty years. Every dusk, I climb the spiral stairs, polish the lens, and turn the switch. The beam cuts through the fog, a steady pulse meant to warn ships away from the rocks. But tonight, something's different.  \n\nThe light flickered as I activated it, then steadied—too steady. I leaned against the wall, watching the beam sweep the horizon. Normally, it would catch the silhouette of a distant vessel, its shadow dancing on the water. Tonight, though, the beam held. For a full minute. Then, in the distance, something moved.  \n\nNot a ship.  \n\nA shape, tall and thin, emerged from the mist. It stood motionless, silhouetted against the glow. My breath hitched. I'd seen fog roll in, seen gulls circle the tower—but never *that*. The figure tilted its head, as if sensing me. Then, slowly, it raised an arm.  \n\nThe light dimmed.  \n\nI stumbled back, heart pounding. The lens hadn't malfunctioned; I'd checked it hours ago. Yet the beam had bent, drawn toward the figure like a magnet. When I blinked, it was gone. Only the fog remained, thick and unyielding.  \n\nA cold dread settled in my chest. I've heard whispers from previous keepers—stories of disappearances, of lights that *didn't* guide ships. But I dismissed them as superstition. Now, I'm not so sure.  \n\nThe switch clicks off. Darkness swallows the tower. Somewhere beyond the rocks, the figure waits. And I wonder: was I ever meant to *see* it?  \n\nThe lamp's glow flickers again, just once, before fading into silence."
