Since Maria is an employee who completed the training (from Statement 3), this statement can definitively apply to her.\n\nBased on these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\nA) Maria completed the training.\n   - From our reasoning above, we know from Statement 3 that \"Maria is an employee who got promoted\" and since Maria completed the training, it follows definitively that she completed the training. \n\nB) Maria received a certificate.\n   - While this statement could be true based on Statement 1 (\"All employees who completed the training received a certificate\"), we don't have enough information to conclude definitively whether Maria has received a certificate just from these statements alone.\n\nC) Maria may or may not have completed the training.\n   - This is incorrect because it contradicts both Statements 1 and 3, which state that completing the training guarantees receiving a certificate. \n\nD) All employees who got promoted completed the training.\n   - While Statement 2 suggests some employees who received certificates got promoted (some did, but others didn't), we cannot definitively conclude based solely on these statements that all promoted employees completed the training.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that can be definitively concluded is:\n\nA) Maria completed the training.",

All employees who completed the training received a certificate.\nThis statement indicates that completing the training is sufficient for receiving a certificate, but it doesn't provide any information about whether getting a certificate implies completing the training.\n\n#### 2. Some employees who received a certificate got promoted.\nThis statement suggests a relationship between receiving a certificate and being promoted; however, it does not specify if every person who gets a certificate necessarily gets promoted or if there are exceptions where someone is promoted without receiving a certificate.\n\n#### 3. Maria is an employee who got promoted.\nThis statement provides information about Maria's promotion status but does not relate directly to the other statements unless we assume that Maria completed the training, which would imply she received the certificate (because all employees who completed the training received certificates).\n\n### Definitive Conclusions\n\n- **A) Maria completed the training.**\n  - We cannot definitively conclude this because the information given is incomplete about whether Maria's promotion was due to completing the training or any other reason.\n\n- **B) Maria received a certificate.**\n  - Given statement 1, we know all employees who completed the training received certificates. Since Maria got promoted and is an employee, it logically follows that Maria completed the training (because only those who completed the training receive certificates).\n\n- **C) Maria may or may not have completed the training.**\n  - We can conclude this because statement 3 does not confirm Maria's completion of the training directly; it merely states she got promoted.\n\n- **D) All employees who got promoted completed the training.**\n  - Statement 2 indicates that some employees received certificates but did not get promoted, so we cannot definitively conclude that every employee promoted completed the training.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only conclusion that can be definitively concluded from the information given is:\n\n**Maria received a certificate.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B) Maria received a certificate.**"

        "few_shot": "**Answer:** C) Maria may or may not have completed the training.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications of the three statements:\n\n1. **All employees who completed the training received a certificate.**  \n   This is a one-way implication:  \n   - **Training → Certificate**  \n   However, it does **not** mean that having a certificate implies completing the training (i.e., **Certificate ← Training** is not guaranteed). There could be other ways to receive a certificate.\n\n2. **Some employees who received a certificate got promoted.**  \n   This tells us that **at least one** employee who has a certificate also got promoted. However, it **does not** mean that **all** promoted employees have a certificate, nor does it guarantee that **all** certificate holders got promoted. It only establishes a partial overlap between certificate holders and promoted employees.\n\n3. **Maria is an employee who got promoted.**  \n   This gives us specific information about Maria: she is in the group of promoted employees.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on the above:\n\n- **A) Maria completed the training.**  \n  This cannot be concluded. There is **no direct link** between Maria's promotion and whether she completed the training. Even if Maria had a certificate (which we don't know), the first statement only says that completing training **leads to** a certificate, not that **having a certificate** implies completing training. Thus, we cannot confirm that Maria completed the training.\n\n- **B) Maria received a certificate.**  \n  This also cannot be concluded. While some certificate holders got promoted, the statement does **not** say that **all** promoted employees have certificates. Therefore, it is possible that Maria is a promoted employee who did **not** receive a certificate. We cannot definitively say she received one.\n\n- **C) Maria may or may not have completed the training.**  \n  This is the **correct** conclusion. Since we do **not** know whether Maria has a certificate (and thus cannot determine whether she completed the training), we must acknowledge that both possibilities (she completed the training or she did not) remain open. This aligns with the information provided.\n\n- **D) All employees who got promoted completed the training.**  \n  This is **too strong** a claim. The statements do not establish that **all** promoted employees have certificates, nor do they guarantee that **all** certificate holders completed the training. Therefore, this conclusion cannot be drawn.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly **C) Maria may or may not have completed the training** can be definitively concluded based on the given information.
