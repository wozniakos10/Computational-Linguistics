        "zero_shot": "### Sentence 1:\n- **Original sentence:** \"The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big.\"\n- **Pronoun:** \"it\"\n- **Interpretation:**\n  - The pronoun \"it\" refers to the suitcase.\n  - Therefore, the trophy is too big.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIn this sentence, \"it\" replaces \"the suitcase.\" Since a trophy cannot fit in a suitcase (as it's likely much larger), \"it was too big.\"\n\n### Sentence 2:\n- **Original sentence:** \"The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too small.\"\n- **Pronoun:** \"it\"\n- **Interpretation:**\n  - The pronoun \"it\" refers to the trophy.\n  - Therefore, the suitcase is too small.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIn this sentence, \"it\" replaces \"the trophy.\" Since a suitcase is designed for carrying items and not specifically intended to fit large objects like trophies, it was unable to accommodate the trophy. Thus, the suitcase is too small.\n\n### Explanation of Word Change:\nBy changing just one word in each original sentence (\"too big\" vs \"too small\"), we alter the meaning of what \"it\" refers to entirely:\n\n- In Sentence 1: \"because it was too big.\"\n- In Sentence 2: \"because it was too small.\"\n\nThe change from a description that fits (the trophy) to one that doesn't fit (the suitcase) fundamentally changes the reference, making \"it\" refer to different objects. This demonstrates how slight variations in language can significantly alter meaning and interpretation.",
        "few_shot": "### Sentence 1:\n**What was too big - the trophy or the suitcase?**\n\n**Output: The suitcase.**\n**Reasoning:** In this sentence, \"it\" is referring to something that didn't fit inside a suitcase because it was too big. Given that both the trophy and the suitcase were involved in the situation (the trophy wasn't able to fit), and the context implies that the problem lies with fitting things into the suitcase, it makes logical sense that the item being described as \"too big\" is the suitcase.\n\n### Sentence 2:\n**What was too small - the trophy or the suitcase?**\n\n**Output: The trophy.**\n**Reasoning:** In this sentence, \"it\" refers to something that didn't fit inside a suitcase because it was too small. Since both the trophy and the suitcase were part of the scenario (the trophy wasn't able to fit in the suitcase), logically, it would make more sense for the item being described as \"too small\" is the trophy.\n\n**Explanation of Change:**\n- **Sentence 1:** The change from \"it was too big\" to \"it was too small\" alters which object is considered \"too.\" In sentence 1, the \"it\" pertains to something that couldn't fit in a suitcase due to being too large. Here, the suitcase becomes the item described as being problematic because it could not accommodate the trophy.\n- **Sentence 2:** Similarly, changing from \"it was too small\" to \"it was too big\" changes which object is considered excessive. In sentence 2, the \"it\" relates to something that couldn't fit in a suitcase due to being too small. Here, the trophy becomes the item described as problematic because it couldn't accommodate within the constraints of the suitcase.\n\nBoth sentences involve changing one word (\"too big\" to \"too small,\" and vice versa) to alter which object is considered problematic. The context provided clearly indicates that these changes are logically consistent with the logical relationship between the items involved in each scenario.",
        "cot": "### Sentence 1 Analysis:\n**The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big.**\n- **What was too big? - The trophy**\n\nIn this sentence, \"the trophy\" is the object that could potentially be oversized or inappropriate for the case.\n- **Reasoning:** The pronoun \"it\" refers to something that was not fitting into the suitcase, likely due to its size being too large. Since the sentence explicitly states that the trophy wasn't fitting and the suitcase had room for it but couldn't accommodate the trophy's dimensions, we can conclude that \"the trophy\" is the item in question.\n\n### Sentence 2 Analysis:\n**The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too small.**\n- **What was too small? - The suitcase**\n\nIn this sentence, \"the suitcase\" is the object that could potentially be inadequate to contain what's inside.\n- **Reasoning:** The pronoun \"it\" refers to something that wasn't fitting into the suitcase, likely due to its size being too small. Since the sentence explicitly states that the trophy wasn't fitting and the suitcase had room for it but couldn't accommodate the trophy's dimensions, we can conclude that \"the suitcase\" is the item in question.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- In **Sentence 1**, \"it was too big.\"\n- In **Sentence 2**, \"it was too small.\"\n\nBy changing just one word (\"big\" to \"small\"), the pronoun's reference switches completely. \n- Changing from \"too big\" to \"too small\" changes what the case (the suitcase) needs or can be inadequate for, thus altering which item is being described as inappropriate.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Sentence 1:** The trophy was too big.\n- **Sentence 2:** The suitcase was too small.\n\nBy changing one word (\"big\" to \"small\"), the pronoun's reference shifts from referring to something that could not fit into the case (the trophy) in Sentence 1, to referring to something that couldn't accommodate the trophy (the suitcase) in Sentence 2."

        "zero_shot": "### **Sentence 1:**  \n**\"The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big.\"**  \n- **Answer:** The **trophy** was too big.  \n- **Reasoning:** The sentence states that the trophy \"didn't fit\" in the suitcase. The reason given is \"because it was too big.\" The pronoun **\"it\"** refers to the **trophy**, as the logical explanation for the trophy not fitting is that it is **too large** to fit inside the suitcase. If the suitcase were too big, the trophy would likely fit, so the adjective \"too big\" aligns with the trophy being the cause of the issue.  \n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 2:**  \n**\"The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too small.\"**  \n- **Answer:** The **suitcase** was too small.  \n- **Reasoning:** Here, the pronoun **\"it\"** refers to the **suitcase**. The sentence now states that the trophy didn't fit because the **suitcase was too small**. This reversal occurs because the adjective \"too small\" logically applies to the **suitcase** (a small suitcase cannot accommodate a trophy). If the trophy were too small, it would fit easily, so the adjective \"too small\" must refer to the suitcase.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why does changing \"big\" to \"small\" flip the reference of \"it\"?**  \nThe pronoun **\"it\"** refers to the noun that the adjective **\"too big\"** or **\"too small\"** logically describes.  \n- **\"Too big\"** implies the trophy is oversized, so **\"it\"** refers to the **trophy**.  \n- **\"Too small\"** implies the suitcase is undersized, so **\"it\"** refers to the **suitcase**.  \n\nThe change in the adjective shifts the focus from the **trophy's size** (in Sentence 1) to the **suitcase's size** (in Sentence 2), altering the reference of **\"it\"** based on context and logical inference.",
        "few_shot": "**Sentence 1 Answer:**  \nThe trophy was too big.  \n**Reasoning:** The sentence states that the trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because \"it was too big.\" Since the trophy is the subject of the main clause (\"The trophy didn't fit...\"), the pronoun \"it\" logically refers to the trophy. A trophy being too large to fit into a suitcase is a coherent explanation, while a suitcase being too big would not explain why the trophy couldn't fit (a large suitcase would likely accommodate a trophy). The causal relationship (\"because\") ties the size of the trophy directly to the problem of not fitting.  \n\n---\n\n**Sentence 2 Answer:**  \nThe suitcase was too small.  \n**Reasoning:** The sentence states that the trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because \"it was too small.\" Here, the adjective \"small\" reverses the logical relationship. If the trophy couldn't fit, the most plausible explanation is that the suitcase was too small to contain the trophy. A trophy being too small would not explain the failure to fit (a small trophy would fit easily). The change from \"big\" to \"small\" flips the reference of \"it\" from the trophy (Sentence 1) to the suitcase (Sentence 2), as the causal relationship now depends on the suitcase's size being the limiting factor.  \n\n---\n\n**Explanation of How the Word Change Affects Reference:**  \nThe shift from \"big\" to \"small\" alters the logical cause-and-effect relationship in the sentence. In Sentence 1, \"too big\" implies the trophy's size is the obstacle, while in Sentence 2, \"too small\" implies the suitcase's size is the obstacle. Pronouns like \"it\" are resolved based on the context of the sentence and the logical coherence of the explanation. The change in the adjective forces the pronoun to refer to a different entity to maintain grammatical and semantic consistency.",
