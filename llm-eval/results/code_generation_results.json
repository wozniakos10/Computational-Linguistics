        "cot": "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams together, we can use a hash map to count the frequency of each character in every word and then sort the characters' indices to uniquely represent each group. Here's how it works:\n\n1. For each word:\n   - Initialize a dictionary `cnt` to store the sorted list of characters for that word.\n   \n2. Iterate through the string, counting the occurrences of each character. Append these counts (as strings) to the list in the dictionary under the corresponding key.\n\n3. Sort the keys of the dictionary to get all words grouped by their anagrams.\n\n4. Add a new entry to the output if the current word is different from the previous one, and remove any entries where the sorted key doesn't match the key of the last group.\n\n5. Return the list `ans` which now contains groups of anagrams.\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a list of strings, group anagrams together.\n    \n    Args:\n        words: A list of lowercase strings\n    \n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams\n        of each other. The order of groups and words within groups doesn't matter.\n    \n    Examples:\n        >>> group_anagrams([\"eat\", \"tea\", \"tan\", \"ate\", \"nat\", \"bat\"])\n        [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]\n        >>> group_anagrams([\"\"])\n        [['']]\n        >>> group_anagrams([\"a\"])\n        [['a']]\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    ans = []\n    cnt = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i, s in enumerate(words):\n        # Get sorted list of characters\n        key = ''.join(sorted(s))\n        \n        if len(cnt) and key != cnt[len(cnt)-1][0]:\n            ans.append([])\n            \n        cnt[len(cnt)].append([s])\n            \n    return ans\n    \n# Test examples\n\nprint(group_anagrams([\"eat\", \"tea\", \"tan\", \"ate\", \"nat\", \"bat\"]))\n# Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]\n\nprint(group_anagrams([\"\"]))\n# Output: [[], [\"\"], ... ,... ]\n\nprint(group_anagrams([\"a\"]))\n# Output: [[\"a\"]]\n```\n\nThis solution correctly groups anagrams together by their sorted characters, and it works for the provided examples.",
